This is a relatively bare skeleton that should help me construct roguelikes
faster.

Random Dungeon Generation is not included here, but I have pathfinding, fog of war,
and LOS

as well as UI state transitions.

This "game" should be able to end and restart.

It also has chunked worlds, so basically providing a dungeon generation algorithm and
inventory system should help complete a roguelike pretty fast.

The bog standard entities aren't very flexible but I'll see if I can change that before
7DRL starts.

This is the "base" that I'm using for 7DRL.
